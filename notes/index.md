 ## Episode 1 Notes:-

Emmet is a free add-on for text editors that allows developers to type shortcuts that are then expanded into full pieces of code. Emmet is also known as Zen Coding. 

Cross origin attribute the mode of request Http cors request. Webpages often  make a request  to load resources on another resources. It request stylesheet,iframe, script,image ,font 


React.development.js & react.production.js are the to main version of react library
React.development.js is intended to use in development & debugging process. It provide additional checks, warning & error for developer at the time of development. So the file size is heavy
React.production.js version is meant to server in production environment.The file size will be compared to react.development.js will be small


1. ReactElement is object which use ReactDom.render() to convert this object to HTML,
2. crossorigin is attribute, mode of request to request HTTP CORS request. It request resouces from another server like style, iframe, script,
3. CDN is Content Delievery Network also know as network distribution and there data center help to provide the data to use with minimal delay


## Episode 2

Npx execute the node package without installing
Package.json is a configuartion for npm
webpack,vite,parcel are the bundler to compose the code & push it  to production

Two types of depenedency 
a. Devedependency => It only use in development
b. Dependency => It is use in  prod/ development

Transitive Depenedency => It means some package having depenedency of some other package & those other package  have dependency of some other packages

## Parcel:- Parcel optimizes your whole app for production automatically. 
1. Dev Build => Parcel includes a development server out of the box. Just run parcel index.html to get started.

2. Local Server

3. HMR = Hot Module Replacement => When you make a change, Parcel automatically updates your code in the browser â€“ no page reload necessary!

4. File Watching Algorithm - Written in C++

5. Caching -  Faster Build

6. Minification => Parcel includes minifiers for JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and SVG out of the box! Just run parcel build index.html, and your whole application will be built and optimized automatically.

7. Bundling

8. Compress the file

9. Constient hashing ==> Read all  these topic as well as mention below

10. Code Splitting

11. Differential Bundling ==> support to older browser as well parcel take care of this

12. Diagnostic => If you make an error in your code or configuration, Parcel displays beautiful diagnostics in your terminal and in the browser.

13. Error handling => To showcase the error in UI in goood UI

14. HTTPs => provide https mode as well as

15. Created different build/bundles for dev & production

16. Tree Shaking

17. Image Optimization => Parcel supports resizing, converting, and optimizing images! 


## .Parcel Cache
The parcel cache  directory is a cache generated by parcel bundler . It store the information about the project when it is built.It allow  parcel  to rebuild the application without  re-parsing & re-anlayzing everything
Parcel-cache directory  enhances the development workflow by speeding up the subsquent build &  optimizing  resource usage

## Tree Shaking
This feature is useful when parcel build  % compress the production code that time it will remove the unused code 


Babel is a JavaScript transpiler, meaning it converts a newer version of ECMAScript, such as ES9, to a standard version (ES5).


Compiling is the transformation from Source Code (human readable) into machine code (computer executable). A compiler is a program.


## Episode -3

Q. What is JSX?
JSX is HTML like syntax
JSX get transpiled before it reaches to JS Engine
JSX => React.CreateElement => Js Object => HTML

Q. Superpower of JSX?
We can write HTML like syntax as well js with using {}
Easily readable for developer easy to debug.

Q.  Role of **type** attribute  in script tag ? what options can I use there?
=> The type attribute define the type of script. Type attribute identifies the content between script tag.By default it have "text/javascript"

Below are the few types attribute:

moduel: This value tell the browser  that the script have module type it can import,export file or module itself. 
type/Ecmascript:This value tell the browser that script is following  the EcmaScript standard. 
babel:This value indicate that the script support the babel type & required babel to transpile it.
text/typescript:This value inidcate that the script is written in typescript.


{TitleComponent} vs <TitleComponent />  vs <TitleComponent> </TitleComponent>
=> {TitleComponent} It is a javascript experssion or variable . The **{}** embed only js variable & experssion
<TitleComponent/> It is a React Component. React it self with the help of **<** angular tag
<TitleComponent></TitleComponent> It is a equivalent to <TitlComponent/>
